In JPA, there are four main types of object relationships:

a. One-to-One (1:1)
In a one-to-one relationship, one entity is related to exactly one other entity, and vice versa. For example, a Person entity may have a one-to-one relationship with an Address entity.

b. One-to-Many (1:N)
In a one-to-many relationship, one entity is related to multiple instances of another entity. For example, a Department entity may have a one-to-many relationship with multiple Employee entities.

c. Many-to-One (N:1)
In a many-to-one relationship, multiple instances of one entity are related to exactly one instance of another entity. For example, multiple Order entities may be associated with one Customer entity.

d. Many-to-Many (N:N)
In a many-to-many relationship, multiple instances of one entity are related to multiple instances of another entity. For example, a Student entity may have a many-to-many relationship with multiple Course entities.
